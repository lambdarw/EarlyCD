# Early Controversy Detection in Short Videos Using Joint Heat Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
EarlyCD is an early-stage multimodal framework that jointly models controversy detection and popularity prediction via a video-guided viewpoint modeling and a task-aware Mixture-of-Experts module.

## ðŸ§· Dataset
We construct the first English-language short-video dataset TMCD, with 3,061 videos covering 244 real-world topics, annotated with both controversy and heat scores.

We evaluate our method for controversy detection on the [TMCD](https://pan.quark.cn/s/d55564522cd3) and [MMCD](https://github.com/skylie-xtj/MM_Controversy_Detection_Released) datasets.


## ðŸš€ Quick Start
